3. **Press** Enter

## Step 5: Installing Game Requirements

The game needs some additional Python libraries to run. Let's install them:

### On Windows:

1. **Type** this command exactly as written:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Press** Enter
3. **Wait** for installation to complete (you'll see text scrolling)

### On Mac:

1. **Type** this command exactly as written:
   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Wait** for installation to complete (you'll see text scrolling)

## Step 6: Starting the Game

Now you're ready to start the game!

### On Windows:

   ```
2. **Press** Enter

## Step 7: Playing the Game

The game should now be running! Here's how to play:

1. **Select "Tutorial"** from the main menu by typing the corresponding number and pressing Enter
2. **Follow** the tutorial instructions to learn the basics
3. **Create a character** when prompted
4. **Start with the easiest challenges** in the Algorithm Forest
5. **Read challenge descriptions carefully**
6. **Use hints** if you get stuck
7. **Don't be afraid to try again** if your solution doesn't work

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Python is not recognized as an internal or external command"

This means Python wasn't added to your PATH during installation.

1. **Reinstall Python**
2. **Make sure to check** "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### "No module named src"

You might not be in the correct folder.

1. **Make sure** you're in the Fantasy Coding Quest folder
2. You should see files like "requirements.txt" when you type `dir` (Windows) or `ls` (Mac)

### Game crashes or shows errors

1. **Take a screenshot** of the error
2. **Try reinstalling** the game requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (or `pip3` on Mac)

## Your First Coding Challenge

When you start the game, look for "The Greeting Spell" challenge:

1. This challenge asks you to create a function that returns "Hello, magical world!"
2. The solution is:
   ```python
   def hello_world():
       return "Hello, magical world!"
   ```
3. Type this code exactly, then type `END` on a new line
4. The game will check your solution and give you feedback

Congratulations, you're now a coding adventurer! Continue with more challenges to improve your skills.
